# Student Result Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing student results using Python. The goal is to provide insights into student performance, identify trends, and visualize data for better understanding.

## Features
- Data Cleaning
- Descriptive Statistics
- Data Visualization
- Performance Analysis
- Trend Identification
- Exporting Results

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are in CSV format. They contain information about student scores across different subjects, along with metadata such as Parents maritial status, ParentsEducation details, and etc demographic details.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive analysis)

## Analysis Steps
1. *Data Cleaning*: Handle missing values and outliers.
2. *Descriptive Statistics*: Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
3. *Data Visualization*: Create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
4. *Performance Analysis*: Analyze scores by gender, age group, and subject.
5. *Trend Identification*: Identify trends over time (if applicable).
